## Discussion 

This is an interesting link I found about using the command
shell. It takes a shell string and provides information about
the various terms of the string. 
Since it's something I've found recently, I haven't used it
very often, but I've bookmarked it because it seems like a helpful
resource for learning how to use the command line interface. It 
also links to another website called showthedocs.com which 
does something similar, but for programming languages like mysql.
Both websites seem like helpful learning tools to me.

## 3rd Party Comments:
The biggest issue I've had in transitioning between different
workflows between different projects is learning the specifics
of each command. It's easy enough to gain a working knowledge,
but to really optimize the workflow and gain some efficiency,
it's important to dig deeper on the commands. As such, I think
this is a great resource for investigating the commands as you
learn them.
