## Discussion 

This is an interesting link I found about using the command
shell. It takes a shell string and provides information about
the various terms of the string. 
Since it's something I've found recently, I haven't used it
very often, but I've bookmarked it because it seems like a helpful
resource for learning how to use the command line interface. It 
also links to another website called showthedocs.com which 
does something similar, but for programming languages like mysql.
Both websites seem like helpful learning tools to me.

## Additional Thoughts

Given how many tools and resources we have at our fingertips in this day and age, it only makes sense that someone created this kind of website to help others with shell commands. I've never seen this website before, but I can see how it will be helpful to me in the future when I'm looking up how to do certain things on the command line. It's also really thoughtful of the creator to link to showthedocs for programming languages, since it's likely that people who would find this site helpful would also find a similar site for programming languages helpful as well. Definitely an interesting and well thought out product!
